# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

- I built this project to show I can code and take the course seriously. 
- I also added many changes to this code to test how well I can code and to see if I can make the website provided somewhat my own.
- The main forcus of this activity was to demonstrait the ability to use sequential order and semantic HTML elements.
- This challenge helped me understand the commands in git bash and to provide me with a better understanding of how GitHub works when cloning repositories 


## Installation

The primary step for the installation of this project was to clone the starter code from canvas correctly. I followed by opening my repository with a unique name with the proper license. After, I started to find the non-semantic elements and replace them with semantic HTML elements to make the HTML document easier to modify and navigate. Along with making semantic HTML elements, I organzied the HTML file to the best of my ability.

## Credits

No other collaborators on this project are in the Bootcamp. I did, however, use youtube to help me code some things in the CSS file and to upload the repositories. The link for the website I used to lock the header in place is https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-create-fixed-header-or-footer-using-css.php#:~:text=Answer%3A%20Use%20CSS%20fixed%20positioning,bottom%20of%20the%20viewport%20accordingly.
